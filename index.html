            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="text">"The Song of Achilles" is a novel by Madeline Miller, which tells the story of the Greek
                mythological
                hero Achilles and his close companion and lover Patroclus. The novel follows their lives from childhood
                through the events of the Trojan War, as well as their relationship and the challenges they face
                together.

                The story is primarily told from the perspective of Patroclus, who is exiled from his home and sent to
                live with Achilles and his family. The two boys become inseparable friends and eventually lovers,
                despite the disapproval of those around them.</p>

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p class="text2">I think that this is a good book it goes very slow paced at first but overall it is a good
                good book it tells a very beautiful story that now has a special place in my heart.It has very beautiful
                and poetic writing one of my favorite quotes from the book is “He is half of my soul as the poets would
                say”.The book shows such growth in characters especially Patroclus he goes from this boy that is so
                unsure of himself to fighting in battles and learning about medicine.In the beginning of the book it
                felt as if everyone was against Patroclus and thought he was useless and i kinda felt that he felt
                unloveable until he met people that showed him all the beautiful things about himself that he was never
                able to see.I can really relate to him in a multitude of ways which is why he is my favorite character.
